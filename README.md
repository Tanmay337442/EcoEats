**EcoEats** is a Flask webapp designed for the 2024 UofT Engineers Without Borders Moral Code Hackathon. The app allows people to log the foods that they purchase, and notifies them when the food is about to expire. The app also has resources to help people learn to cook, and generates nutritious recipes using AI, based on the food they have available.

Features:
- Date picker to set the expiry date of food
- Notifications when foods are about to expire
- Meal planning - note, the AI feature is only for demonstration purposes, and is not functional because it requires an API key
- Page to receive feedback on the app and how it can be improved

Run the `__init__.py` file in the app folder, and navigate to localhost:5000 in your browser to view the app.
